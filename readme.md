# NO MORE REST

No more rest calls! Call directly your backend APIs from EVERYWHERE! üåçüöÄ

Simplify and boost your development process, with this small package you are allowed to integrate continuously your backend APIs and your client code directly.

With a smart generator that create in real time (_with a -watch mode_) a small proxy, you're able to call transparently your remote functions with all the support you need (intellisense, types, return types and more).

## Installation

Install the package on the server project with `npm i no-more-rest`

## Usage

Wrap your APIs and expose via express in this way

```javascript
//serverAPI.js

export function sayHi() {
  console.log("Called transparently from the client");
}
export function pow(n) {
  return n * n;
}
```

```javascript
// server.js

import express from "express";
const app = express();

import { expose } from "no-more-rest";

import * as yourApi from "./serverAPI";

expose(app, yourApi);

app.listen(8000);
```

- Add this npm script to your package to generate the proxy script for the client from the exposed module

```json
"scripts": {
   "sync": "no-more-rest --input serverAPI.js --output-dir ../your-client-path/"
}
```

- Import in the client your generated proxy and use it as if it were on your backend.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Your website</title>
    <script src="./serverAPI.js"></script>

    <script>
      // Both support of intellisense and typecheck
      proxy.sayHi();

      proxy.pow(3).then((powResult) => console.log(powResult));
    </script>
  </head>
</html>
```

## Configuration

The *no-more-rest* cli support these parameters

- **--input** - _the file that exposes the functions_

- **--output-dir** - _The destination folder_

- **--typescript-output** - _Typescript output format_

- **--filename** - _Filename to generate_

- **--watch** - _Watch and generate the proxy file_

## Dependencies
Actually body-parser is a dependency on the server to be able to parse json body.
